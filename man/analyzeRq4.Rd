\code{analyzeRq4(brfss)}{Performs analyses for research question #4:
Is there a relationship between depression, chronic disease and the use of health care services?}
}
\details{
This function analyzes the effects of depression and chronic illness on the
response variable, the number of doctor office visits during the 12 months
preceding the survey.  This analysis is conducted in the following five
sections.
}
\section{Acquire Data}{

This section extracts the number of doctor visits as well as the
depression and chronic illnesses indicator variables.
}

\section{Create Marginal and Joint Contingency Tables}{

This section renders the tables that illuminate the marginal and joint
effects of depression and chronic illness on the number of doctor visits
reported.  Descriptive statistics of doctor visits are also reported
for both depression and chronic illness, as well as their joint
effects on the number of doctor visits reported.
}

\section{Plots}{

In this section, frequency and proportion bar plots, box plots, violin
plots and histograms are rendered to illuminate the distribution of
doctor visits vis-a-vis chronic illness and depression diagnoses.
}

\section{Statistical Tests}{

In this section, the non-parametric Wilcoxin signed-rank and the
the Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov tests were administered to ascertain the
effect of depression and chronic illness on the number of doctor visits
reported.  The Wilcox test compared the mean number of doctor visits
reported for both depression and chronic disease diagnoses for
statistically significant differences.  The Komogorov-Smirnov tests
were conducted pairwise to reveal relative effects of depression
and chronic illness on doctor visits reported.
