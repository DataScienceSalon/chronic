\code{analyzeRq3(brfss)}{Performs analyses for research question #3,
To what degree does depression with co-occurring chronic illness affect
productivity, vis-a-vis that of diagnoses of depression or chronic illness
separately?}
}
\details{
This function analyzes the effects of depression and chronic illness on the
response variable,  the number of sick days reported in the 30 days
preceding the survey.  This analysis is conducted in the following five
sections.
}
\section{Acquire Data}{

This section extracts the number of sick days and the sick days range
variable, as well as the depression and chronic illnesses indicator
variables.
}

\section{Create Marginal and Joint Contingency Tables}{

This section renders the tables that illuminate the marginal and joint
effects of depression and chronic illness on the number of sick days
reported.  Descriptive statistics of sick days are also reported
for both depression and chronic illness, as well as their joint
effects on the number of sick days reported.
}

\section{Plots}{

In this section, frequency and proportion bar plots, box plots, violin
plots and histograms are rendered to illuminate the distribution of
sick days vis-a-vis chronic illness and depression diagnoses.
}

\section{Statistical Tests}{

In this section, the non-parametric Wilcoxin signed-rank and the
the Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov tests were administered to ascertain the
effect of depression and chronic illness on the number of sick days
reported.  The Wilcox test compared the mean number of sick days
reported for both depression and chronic disease diagnoses for
statistically significant differences.  The Komogorov-Smirnov tests
were conducted pairwise to reveal relative effects of depression
and chronic illness on sick days reported.
