Description: A statistical analysis of depression in the United States, 
    its prevalence, sociodemographics, comorbidity with other chronic illnesses,
    and its costs. The data source for this project was the Centers for 
    Disease Control and Prevention's 2013 Behavioral Risk
    Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) Survey, a national, state-based
    cross-sectional telephone survey of over 500,000 American respondents,
    capturing and documenting health practices and behavioral factors
    such as tobacco use, HIV/AIDS knowledge and prevention, exercise, 
    immunization, health status, healthy days â€” health-related quality of 
    life, health care access, inadequate sleep, hypertension awareness, 
    cholesterol awareness, chronic health conditions, alcohol consumption, 
    fruits and vegetables consumption, arthritis burden, and seatbelt use.
    The aim of the analysis was to engage four questions: (1) is there 
    a relationship between socioeconomic status and depression, (2) to 
    what degree does depression co-occur with other chronic conditions 
    such as heart disease, diabetes, asthma, kidney disease, asthma and 
    other lung diseases, (3) what are the marginal, conditional, and joint 
    effects of depression on productivity vis-a-vis those of other 
    chronic illnesses and (4) how does depression affect costs in 
    terms of health service utilization, compared to other chronic 
    disorders.
