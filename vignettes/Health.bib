abstract = {Background Quantification of the disease burden caused by different risks informs prevention by providing an account of health loss different to that provided by a disease-by-disease analysis. No complete revision of global disease burden caused by risk factors has been done since a comparative risk assessment in 2000, and no previous analysis has assessed changes in burden attributable to risk factors over time. Methods We estimated deaths and disability-adjusted life years; DALYs; sum of years lived with disability [YLD] and years of life lost [YLL]) attributable to the independent effects of 67 risk factors and clusters of risk factors for 21 regions in 1990 and 2010. We estimated exposure distributions for each year, region, sex, and age group, and relative risks per unit of exposure by systematically reviewing and synthesising published and unpublished data. We used these estimates, together with estimates of cause-specific deaths and DALYs from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010, to calculate the burden attributable to each risk factor exposure compared with the theoretical-minimum-risk exposure. We incorporated uncertainty in disease burden, relative risks, and exposures into our estimates of attributable burden. Findings In 2010, the three leading risk factors for global disease burden were high blood pressure (7 0{\%} [95{\%} uncertainty interval 6 2-7 7] of global DALYs); tobacco smoking including second-hand smoke (6 3{\%} [5 5-7 0]), and alcohol use (5 5{\%} [5 0-5 9]). In 1990, the leading risks were childhood underweight (7 9{\%} [6 8-9 4]), household air pollution from solid fuels; (HAP; 7 0{\%} [5 6-8 3]), and tobacco smoking including second-hand smoke (6 1{\%} [5 4-6 8]). Dietary risk factors and physical inactivity collectively accounted for 10 0{\%} (95{\%} UI 9 2-10 8) of global DALYs in 2010, with the most prominent dietary risks being diets low in fruits and those high in sodium. Several risks that primarily affect childhood communicable diseases, including unimproved water and sanitation and childhood micronutrient deficiencies, fell in rank between 1990 and 2010, with unimproved water ' and sanitation accounting for 0 9{\%} (0 4-1 6) of global DALYs in 2010. However, in most of sub-Saharan Africa childhood underweight, HAP, and non-exclusive and discontinued breastfeeding were the leading risks in 2010, while HAP was the leading risk in south Asia. The leading risk factor in Eastern Europe, most of Latin America, and southern sub-Saharan Africa in 2010 was alcohol use; in most of Asia, North Africa and Middle East, and central Europe it was high blood pressure. Despite declines, tobacco smoking including second-hand smoke remained the leading risk in high-income north America and western Europe. High body-mass index has increased globally and it is the leading risk in Australasia and southern Latin America, and also ranks high in other high-income regions, North Africa and Middle East, and Oceania. Interpretation Worldwide, the contribution of different risk factors to disease burden has changed substantially, with a shift away from risks for communicable diseases in children towards those for non-communicable diseases in adults. These changes are related to the ageing population, decreased mortality among children younger than 5 years, changes in cause-of-death composition, and changes in risk factor exposures. New evidence has led to changes in the magnitude of key risks including unimproved water and sanitation, vitamin A and zinc deficiencies, and ambient particulate matter pollution. The extent to which the epidemiological shift has occurred and what the leading risks currently are varies greatly across regions. In much of sub-Saharan Africa, the leading risks are still those associated with poverty and those that affect children.},

abstract = {Clinical and epidemiologic evidence suggests that alcoholism complicated by concurrent or a lifetime history of depression is slower to remit and more prone to relapse than uncomplicated alcoholism. Consequently, alcoholics with a history of depressive illness, on average, are likely to use more health care and to have higher treatment costs than those without depression complications. This article contrasts evidence of the suitability of three models for predicting the impact of depression on an alcoholic's health-care use: a null model (assuming no differences) a cumulative-effect model (arguing for a linear increase associated with comorbid depression), and a synergistic model (wherein alcoholism complicated with depression is qualitatively as well as quantitatively different than uncomplicated alcoholism). To test these models, health-care costs and utilization of 491 ``pure'' alcoholics (those with no history of depression diagnosis) and 199 depression-complicated alcoholics, who received alcohol treatment while enrolled in a self-insured health-care program of a major U.S. manufacturing company, were compared. Results are discussed in terms of the implications for cost containment and the likelihood of relapse among the depression-complicated alcoholism group.},

In this paper we make the less restrictive assumption that such a normal, homoscedastic, linear model is appropriate after some suitable transformation has been applied to the y's. Inferences about the transformation and about the parameters of the linear model are made by computing the likelihood function and the relevant posterior distribution. The contributions of normality, homoscedasticity and additivity to the transformation are separated. The relation of the present methods to earlier procedures for finding transformations is discussed. The methods are illustrated with examples. 1.},

The result of Cram{\{}{\'{e}}{\}}r's work is a masterly exposition of the mathematical methods of modern statistics that set the standard that others have since sought to follow. For anyone with a working knowledge of undergraduate mathematics the book is self contained. The first part is an introduction to the fundamental concept of a distribution and of integration with respect to a distribution. The second part contains the general theory of random variables and probability distributions while the third is devoted to the theory of sampling, statistical estimation, and tests of significance.},

abstract = {Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and odds of major depression and the incremental effect of major depression on utilization, lost productivity and functional disability in individuals with common chronic medical disorders. Method: Data on 30,801 adults from the 1999 National Health Interview Survey were analyzed. The 12-month prevalence and age/sex-adjusted odds of major depression were calculated for adults with hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), stroke or cerebrovascular accident (CVA), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The association between chronic condition status (with and without major depression) and utilization, lost productivity and functional disability was determined by controlling for covariates. Results: The 12-month prevalence and age/sex-adjusted odds of major depression by chronic conditions were as follows: CHF, 7.9{\%} [odds ratio (OR)=1.96]; HTN, 8.0{\%} (OR=2.00); DM, 9.3{\%} (OR=1.96); CAD, 9.3{\%} (OR=2.30); CVA, 11.4{\%} (OR=3.15); COPD, 15.4{\%} (OR=3.21); ESRD, 17.0{\%} (OR=3.56); any chronic condition, 8.8{\%} (OR=2.61). Compared to adults without chronic conditions, those with chronic conditions plus major depression had greater odds of ???1 ambulatory visit [OR=1.50; 95{\%} confidence interval (95{\%} CI)=1.28, 1.77]; ???1 emergency room visit (OR=1.94; 95{\%} CI=1.55, 2.45); and ???1 day in bed due to illness (OR=1.60; 95{\%} CI=1.28, 2.00); and functional disability (OR=2.48; 95{\%} CI=1.96, 3.15). Conclusion: The 12-month prevalence and odds of major depression are high in individuals with chronic medical conditions, and major depression is associated with significant increases in utilization, lost productivity and functional disability. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The economic burden of depression in the United States--including major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder, and dysthymia--was estimated at {\$}83.1 billion in 2000. We update these findings using recent data, focusing on MDD alone and accounting for comorbid physical and psychiatric disorders.\backslashn\backslashnMETHOD: Using national survey (DSM-IV criteria) and administrative claims data (ICD-9 codes), we estimate the incremental economic burden of individuals with MDD as well as the share of these costs attributable to MDD, with attention to any changes that occurred between 2005 and 2010.\backslashn\backslashnRESULTS: The incremental economic burden of individuals with MDD increased by 21.5{\%} (from {\$}173.2 billion to {\$}210.5 billion, inflation-adjusted dollars). The composition of these costs remained stable, with approximately 45{\%} attributable to direct costs, 5{\%} to suicide-related costs, and 50{\%} to workplace costs. Only 38{\%} of the total costs were due to MDD itself as opposed to comorbid conditions.\backslashn\backslashnCONCLUSIONS: Comorbid conditions account for the largest portion of the growing economic burden of MDD. Future research should analyze further these comorbidities as well as the relative importance of factors contributing to that growing burden. These include population growth, increase in MDD prevalence, increase in treatment cost per individual with MDD, changes in employment and treatment rates, as well as changes in the composition and quality of MDD treatment services.},
